# EMURGO Academy Haskell Course: Haskell Snake

This repository contains a preconfigured Haskell development environment, allowing you to start coding in Haskell with zero installation using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and a browser-based version of VS Code.

## Create Your Environment

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the link to your new repository and prefix it with "https://gitpod.io/#" in your browser
3. Click `Continue with GitHub` and `Authorize gitpod-io`
4. Wait for the environment to build. This can take a while the first time.
